## The High Cost of Being Late

Late arrivals can impact both your personal and professional life in significant ways:

- **Missed Flights:** A delayed ride to the airport can mean rebooking fees, missed connections, or even losing an entire trip.
- **Lost Business Opportunities:** Tardiness can damage client relationships, delay deals, and create a lasting negative impression.
- **Ruined Events:** From weddings to anniversaries and proms, poor transportation can throw off the entire schedule.
- **Stress & Anxiety:** The uncertainty of whether your ride will show up adds unnecessary mental burden to your day.

These issues are far too common in New York, especially when relying on ride-share apps or cheap transport alternatives. That's why so many people are switching to **Limousine Hub**.
